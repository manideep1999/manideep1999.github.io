A custom Battery Management System was designed and developed end to end. This involves the pcb designing, cell data logging and telemetry. The system/cells data is wirelessly transferred using a CAN protocol to a PC using BeagleBone black processor where a real time GUI using GTK+ dashboard is created to display all the cell statistics and their criticality statuses.
