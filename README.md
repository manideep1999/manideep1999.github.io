## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

I've always wanted to have a personal website where I could efficiently structure my work and experiences. After spending a day or two looking via the internet, I found Brittany's code, which was incredibly simple. I started by spending twoÂ days working through the Gatsby tutorial because I wasn't that good with the most recent web development tools. This helped me quickly catch up with the language.

After that, I looked over the code againÂ and made the necessary changes. It was really a straight forward process, especially because her code was well-commented. Changing the logo using Scalable Vector Graphics was tricky. After learning about it for a while, it was not that difficult.

Once more, many thanks to Brittany for her permission. If you fork the repository as well, kindly give credit to her.
